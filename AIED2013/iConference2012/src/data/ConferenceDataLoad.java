		Conference.description ="<b>AIED 2013:</b><br/>The 16th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED2013) is the next in a longstanding series of biennial international conferences for high quality research in intelligent systems and cognitive science for educational computing applications. The conference provides opportunities for the cross-fertilization of approaches, techniques and ideas from the many fields that comprise AIED, including computer science, cognitive and learning sciences, education, game design, psychology, sociology, linguistics, as well as many domain-specific areas. Since the first AIED meeting 30 years ago, both the breadth of the research and the reach of the technologies has expanded in dramatic ways. The theme of AIED2013 therefore seeks to capture this evolution: From education to lifelong learning: constructing pervasive and enduring environments for learning. In line with this theme of expansion, AIED2013 will also introduce a new category for Industry Papers which will seek to capture the challenges, solutions, and results from the transition of AIED technologies into the commercial sector.<br/><br/><b>EDM 2013:</b><br/>The 6th International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM 2013) invites papers that study how to apply data mining to analyze data generated by various information systems supporting learning or education (in schools, colleges, universities, and other academic or professional learning institutions providing traditional and modern forms and means of teaching, as well as informal learning). EDM may require adaptation of existing or development of new approaches that build upon techniques from a combination of areas, including but not limited to statistics, psychometrics, machine learning, information retrieval, recommender systems and scientific computing.";

        k.description = "The design of learning experiences is a challenging undertaking. Designing interactive learning experiences for informal educational settings, such as museums, presents even greater challenges due to the particularities of context. The informal learning context differs from that of formal education in key areas, which can largely influence and complicate the design of an interactive system. To name just a few: the target audience is heterogeneous with diverse goals, expectations, and abilities; interaction with the learning content unavoidably takes the form of brief encounters rather than longitudinal exposure to it; the connection of the virtual to physical objects and space is crucial and must be seamless; visitor mobility in the physical space may entail navigation, orientation and location-based subsystems, all of which can further complicate and disrupt the visitor?s immersive experience; personalization of learning is inevitably in conflict with the inherently social activity of visiting a museum, thus placing additional tension on how to support individualized learning while also facilitating social interaction.    A possible way to overcome these challenges is through a general shift in practice to designing personalized interactive experiences with rather than for users of digital systems. The successful application of digital technology for learning must be guided by an understanding of how people use technology and how this technology is able to fit to their personal interests and aspirations, learning styles, existing knowledge and mental models, as well as their current (at the time of use) mood and preferences. In this presentation, the implications of applying user modeling and human computer interaction methods, such as participatory design, in the design of informal learning experiences will be highlighted. A range of case studies in real settings and their respective formative and summative evaluation effort will be explored.";

        k.description = "You can discover more about a person in an hour of play than in a year of conversation (Plato). For the past 6-7 years, I have been examining ways to leverage good video games to assess and support important student competencies, especially those that are not optimally measured by traditional assessment formats. The term \"stealth assessment\" refers to the process of embedding assessments deeply and invisibly into the gaming environment. Though this approach produces ample real-time data on a player's interactions within the game environment and preserves player engagement, a primary challenge for using stealth assessment in games is taking this stream of data and making valid inferences about players' competencies that can be examined at various points in time (to see growth), and also at various grain sizes (for diagnostic purposes). In this talk, I will present recent work related to creating and embedding three stealth assessments--for creativity, conscientiousness, and qualitative physics understanding--into Newton's Playground, a game we developed that emphasizes nonlinear gameplay and puzzle-solving in a 2D physics simulation environment. I will begin by framing the topic in terms of why this type of research is sorely needed in education, then generally describe the stealth assessment approach, and finally provide some concrete examples of how to do it and how well it works regarding validity issues, learning, and enjoyment from a recent research study.";

        k.description = "It is possible to combine multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and hidden Markov models (HMM) to discover the major phases that students go through in solving complex problems. I will illustrate this methodology by applying it to the learning of graphical isomorphs of algebra problems. We discovered a sequence of 5 major phases that students went through: An Orient Phase where they identified the problem to be solved, an Encode Phase where they encoded the needed information, a Compute Phase where they performed the necessary arithmetic calculations, a Transform Phase where they performed any mathematical transformations, and a Respond Phase where they generated the answer. The duration of the Compute and Transform Phases were they only ones that distinguished different problem types. Increased duration in these two phases is also associated with making errors. Looking at learning, 2 features distinguished the problems on which participants came to understand a new problem type. First, the duration of late phases of the problem solution increased. Second, there was increased activation in the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) and angular gyrus (AG), regions associated with metacognition. We think this indicates the importance of reflection to successful learning.";

        k.description = "We've started to answer the questions of what we can model through EDM, and we're getting better and better at modeling each year. We publish papers that present solid numbers under reasonably stringent cross-validation, and we find that our models don't just agree with training labels, but can predict future performance and engagement as well. We're making progress as a field in figuring out how to use these models to drive and support intervention, although there's a whole lot more to learn. But when and where can we trust our models? One of the greatest powers of EDM models is that we can use them outside the contexts in which they were originally developed, but how can we trust that we're doing so wisely and safely? Theory from machine learning and statistics can be used to study generalizability, and we know empirically that models developed with explicit attention to generalizability and construct validity are more likely to generalize and to be valid. But our conceptions and characterizations of population and context remain insufficient to fully answer the question of whether a model will be valid where will apply it. What's worse, the world is constantly changing; the model that works today may not work tomorrow, if the context changes in important ways, and we don't know yet which changes matter. In this talk, I will illustrate these issues by discussing our work to develop models that generalize across urban, rural, and suburban settings in the United States, and to study model generalizability internationally. I will discuss work from other groups that starts to think more carefully about characterizing context and population in a concrete and precise fashion; where this work is successful, and where it remains incomplete. By considering these issues more thoroughly, we can become increasingly confident in the applicability, validity, and usefulness of our models for broad and general use, a necessity for using EDM in a complex and changing world.";

        k.description = "A central goal of education involves helping students develop deep understandings of complex models at the heart of core learning goals. Interestingly, an analogous goal of commercial recreational digital games involves helping players develop deep understandings of the models at the heart of those games. Given that games can motivate players to engage voluntarily over extended periods of time in developing understandings of complex game models, one may ask whether and how one might foster similar engagement with educational concepts and models. Much fanfare has accompanied claims about games? potential for engagement and motivation, but many of those claims have focused on a shallow idea of ?fun?. This talk takes a deeper view of motivation and learning by considering motivation and games through the lens of research on motivation to learn in classrooms. The talk then considers how research from the learning sciences, psychology, and science education can expand this motivation framework to scaffold the integration of intuitive and formal understanding through games for learning. Discussion of these ideas is framed in terms of examples from commercial game design and from our ongoing research and development of games to support physics learning.";

        p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>We compared two versions of an affect-sensitive embodied conversational agent for Aplusix, an intelligent tutoring system for algebra. Version 1 of the agent was able to detect and respond to user affect, but it responded too quickly and too frequently. The second version of the agent featured new student models for detecting and responding to student affective states, which is less sensitive compared to the first version. We conducted a field test with students to determine its effect on learning and learning experience in comparison to using Aplusix alone and Aplusix with the version 1 agent. Results show that version 2 provided significantly fewer interventions to engaged students, more evaluations of engagement, fewer evaluations of boredom, and was generally preferred over version 1.</p>";

We analyze what behaviors and affective states co-occur, what behavior precedes affect, and what affect precedes behavior. We study these relationships in the context of four different software programs, involving students of different ages, in order to increase confidence in the generalizability of the findings.

We investigated how individual differences (e.g., prior knowledge, interest, attributional complexity) impacted confusion and learning outcomes in an environment that induced confusion via false system feedback (e.g., negative feedback after a correct response). A k-means cluster analysis revealed four clusters that varied on cognitive ability and cognitive drive. We found that students in the high cognitive ability + high cognitive drive cluster reported more confusion after receiving false feedback compared to the other clusters.

The algorithm decomposes students' complete interaction histories to create hierarchies of interdependent tasks that describe their activities in ELEs. It matches students' actions to a predefined grammar in the way that reflects students' typical use of ELEs, namely that students solve problems in a modular fashion but may still interleave between their activities. The algorithm was empirically evaluated on people's interaction with two separate ELEs for simulating a chemistry laboratory and for modeling stochastic events. It was separately compared to the state-of-the-art recognition algorithm for each of the ELEs. The results show that the algorithm was able to infer students' activities correctly significantly more often than the state-of-the-art, and was able to generalize to both of the ELEs with no intervention.

In particular the design features of a tutor have found to predict substantial amounts of variance in gaming and off-task behavior. However, it is not yet understood how this influence takes place. In this paper we investigate the relationship between a student???s affective state, their tendency to engage in disengaged behavior, and the design aspects of the learning environments, to-wards understanding the role that affect plays in this process. To investigate this question, we integrate an existing taxonomy of the features of tutor lessons [3] with automated detectors of affect [8]. We find that confusion and frustration are significantly associated with lesson features which were found to be associated with disengaged behavior in past research. At the same time, we find that the affective state of engaged concentration is significantly associated with features associated with lower frequencies of disengaged behavior. This analysis suggests that simple re-designs of tutors along these lines may lead to both better affect and less disengaged behavior.</p>";

Toward the goal of automatic assessment of learning materials, we conducted a laboratory experiment involving 50 college students recruited from two universities in Korea using 115 PowerPoint files. Each participant examined five PowerPoint files while thinking aloud about the difficulty aspects of each slide. All participants' utterances were recorded and transcribed. Using a grounded theory based analysis approach, we performed an iterative coding process that resulted in 41 difficulty factors. A card-sorting exercise was further conducted to confirm the distribution of the difficulty factors over the seven categories of learning difficulty. On the basis of the results, we propose a model of learning difficulty, distinguishing measurable factors from non-measurable factors. The most influential factors for the easiest and the hardest learning materials are also identified and compared.

Field-testing, however, requires activities such as observing and searching at specific positions within a site, which requires the learner to move about to get to those positions. Moreover, the time that can be spent taking such an on-site test is usually limited, which means that the test may end before a sufficient number of test items can be answered thereby decreasing the accuracy of ability estimation.

This in turn significantly increases the efficiency of our automated knowledge acquisition algorithm. In a separate but related analysis, we present a novel game called a Knowledge-Refinement Game (KRG) that motivates SMEs to refine the generated knowledge base for data in which the system has low confidence in its accuracy. Utilizing an anonymous agreement policy ensures the quality of SME responses and results show that small amounts of KRG play leads to noticeable improvements in the quality of the knowledge base.

The W-Pal ITS includes strategy instruction, game-based practice, and essay-based practice with automated feedback. In the ITS condition, students received strategy training and wrote and revised one essay in each of the 8 training sessions. In the AWE condition, students only interacted with the essay writing and automated feedback tools in W-Pal. These students wrote and revised two essays in each of the 8 sessions. Indices of local and global cohesion reported by the computational tools Coh-Metrix and the Writing Assessment Tool (WAT) were used to investigate pretest and posttest writing gains. For both the ITS and the AWE systems, training led to the increased use of global cohesion features in essay writing.

The typical effect sizes achieved by ITSs are around 1SD, which are still low in comparison to the effectiveness of expert human tutors. Recently there have been several analyses done in order to identify the factors that contribute to success of human tutors, and to replicate it in ITSs. VanLehn (2012) proposes that the crucial factor is the granularity of interaction: the lower the level of discussions between the (human or artificial) tutor and the student, the higher the effectiveness. We report on a study that investigated the effect of interaction granularity in the context of NORMIT, a constraint-based tutor that teaches data normalization. The study compared the standard version of NORMIT that provided hints in response to incorrect solutions, to a version which used adaptive tutorial dialogues instead of hints.

We report the results of a think-aloud study that aimed to assess how understandable the OLM visualizations are and how well learners can link them to assessing performance in terms of the following aspects: (1) if and when an individual was contributing to the brainstorming; (2) when a group or individual is stuck; and (3) when group members 'spark' off of each other. Our contributions are: the definition of an approach to creating models of key aspects of brainstorming, an open learner model of a group and individual processes and results of our user study which indicated that participants found the OLM visualisations supportive and could clearly identify when a group made most of their ideas, when a group or individual was stuck and how ideas were categorized.</p>";

One desirable feedback feature is problem localization, which has been shown to positively correlate with feedback implementation in both student papers and argument diagrams. In this paper we demonstrate that features previously developed for identifying localization in paper reviews do not work well when applied to peer reviews of argument diagrams. We develop a novel algorithm tailored for reviews of argument diagrams, and demonstrate significant performance improvements in identifying problem localization in an experimental evaluation.</p>";

Coh-Metrix indices for the texts read by the students were compared to students' (n = 126) self-explanation scores to examine the degree to which linguistic indices predicted students' self-explanation quality during training. Initial analyses indicated that there was no relation between students' self-explanation scores on a given text and its linguistic properties.

        p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Web brings about a lot of opportunities for learners to investigate a topic with Web resources to learn, which allows them to construct a wider, deeper, and timely knowledge from the resources. On the other hand, such investigative learning process involves creating a scenario that explains what to and how to investigate with Web resources. The learning scenario could also allow the learners to reflect on the constructed knowledge after investigative learning pro-cess. However, it is quite difficult for the learners to create their own learning scenario concurrent with knowledge construction from the contents of the resources. The main issue addressed in this paper is how to scaffold learning scenario creation. This paper presents a model of investigative learning, which induces learners to create the learning scenario by decomposing the topic into sub-topics to be learned while searching and learning the Web resources. In this model, the learning scenario is represented as the tree of topics investigated. This paper also demonstrates an interactive learning scenario builder iLSB for short, which provides a scaffold for the learners to build their own scenario in learning with Web resources to define their investigation task. The results of the case study suggest that iLSB makes learner-created scenarios more structured, and that it allows the learners to promote their reflection on knowledge constructed during investigative learning process.</p>";

To solve these problems, we regard selecting an item from an item bank as a decision making in Bayesian theory and propose a new item selection criterion we call expected value of test information (EVTI). The unique features of EVTI are that it 1) maximizes the prediction utility of an examinee's ability estimation and 2) generates a decision tree with an item selection order based on the examinee's responses. The CAT references the tree and then instantaneously selects and presents the optimal item from an item bank.

To illustrate our point, we present the results of comparing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based adaptive feedback system to a system that does not utilize NLP capabilities. We show that, while there were no learning gain dif-ferences between the two systems, the correlates to gain were different. In the non-NLP system, only student performance during the training was correlated to learning gain. In the adaptive system, many more variables predicted learning, including measures of system capability and student satisfaction.

Participants who studied the difficult version of the texts reported significantly higher rates of mind-wandering (d = .41) and lower arousal both during (d = .52) and after the learn-ing session (d = .48). Mind wandering and arousal were not affected by choice. However, participants who were assigned to study the topic they selected re-ported significantly more positive valence during (d = .57) but not after learning. These participants also scored substantially higher on a subsequent knowledge test (d = 1.27).

Analysis of video data from 8 participants interacting with the ECHOES VE showed that they frequently detected and visibly reacted to system-side errors, engaging in the positive, socio-communicative behaviours which ECHOES aimed to promote. In particular, they initiated to social partners about what happened and should have happened. Detecting such errors requires children to compare the VE's events to their mental model of its contents and rules, determining where the two are discrepant and why. This is similar to learners identifying mistakes in their own knowledge and then re-aligning with the system-as-expert. This paper explores the implications of these results, focusing on learner detection of deliberate system-side errors as a possible pedagogic strategy, alongside more traditional strategies for correcting learner errors.</p>";

We define a decision policy that selects whichever tutor action the trained classifier predicts in the current situation is likeliest to lead to a successful outcome. The ideal but costly way to evaluate such a policy is to implement it in the tutor and collect new data, which may require months of tutor use by hundreds of students. Instead, we use historical data to simulate a policy by extrapolating its effects from the subset of randomized decisions that happened to follow the policy. We then compare policies based on alternative student models by their simulated impact on the success rate of tutorial decisions. We test the method on data logged by Project LISTEN's Reading Tutor, which chooses randomly which type of help to give on a word. We report the cross-validated accuracy of predictions based on four types of student models, and compare the success rates of the resulting policies. The method provides a utility-relevant metric to compare student models expressed in very different formalisms.</p>";

Thus, there are no guidelines for the effective use of multiple graphical representations. We describe research-based principles for the use of multiple graphical representations within ITSs. These principles are the outcome of a series of iterative classroom experiments with the Fractions Tutor with over 3,000 students. The implementation of these principles into the Fractions Tutor results in robust learning. To our knowledge, the Fractions Tutor is the first ITS to use multiple graphical representations by implementing research-based principles to support conceptual learning.

We present an experimental study which contrasts two hypotheses on how these learning processes interact. Does understanding facilitate fluency-building processes, or does fluency enhance sense-making processes? And consequently, which learning process should intelligent tutoring systems support first? Our results based on test data and tutor logs show an advantage for providing support for sense-making processes before fluency-building processes.

To evaluate the effectiveness of JITs, we conducted a naturalistic experiment where learning from older versions of the software, which did not include specific JITs, was contrasted with a later version that included the JITs.

The technology, in the form of a distant peer, models both social and science information in one of three dialectal patterns: AAVE features in both tasks, no AAVE features in either task, and AAVE features in social, but not science, tasks. We found that our participants, all native AAVE-speaking students, demonstrated better science talk with a technology that provided information in AAVE, and best when the peer model communicated with AAVE features in both tasks. Additionally, students with a non-AAVE speaking agent performed significantly better the less AAVE they spoke themselves.

Here we explore the generality of these methods by considering a very different task, article selection in English, where little problem-solving is done, but where complex prior perceptual skills and large amounts of background knowledge are needed. This background knowledge includes the ability to parse text and the extensive understanding of semantics of English words and phrases. We show that good performance can be obtained by coupling SimStudent with appropriate broad-coverage linguistic tools. Performance can be improved further on this task by extending one of the learning mechanisms used by SimStudent so that it will accept less-accurate production rule conditions, and prioritize learned production rules by accuracy. Experimental results show that the extended SimStudent successfully learns the tutored article selection grammar rules, and can be used to discover a student model that predicts human student behavior as well as the human-generated model.</p>";

The two mappings of items to skills, the expert on on side and the matrix factorization on the other, are compared in terms of discrepancies, and in terms of their performance when used in a linear model of skills assessment and item outcome prediction. Visual analysis shows a relatively similar pattern between the expert and the factorized mappings, although differences arise. The prediction comparison shows the factorization approach performs slightly better than the original expert Q-matrix, giving supporting evidence to the belief that the factorization mapping is valid.

For instance, problems presented to students might be atypical and demanding in their content and/or presentation, relative to standard practice. Erroneous examples, an unusual and challenging form of learning material, are arguably a type of desirable difficulty for students that could lead to deeper learning. In the study reported in this paper six hundred and thirty seven students at 4 middle schools completed a web-based intervention. Students were assigned either to an interactive erroneous examples condition, in which they were prompted to find, explain and correct decimal errors, or to a control condition that solved traditional, isomorphic versions of the same problems. The erroneous examples group showed a significant benefit on a delayed posttest --- but not on an immediate posttest --- consistent with previous findings in the desirable difficulties literature. An additional 82 students used an adaptive version of the erroneous examples --- adapted automatically to misconceptions displayed by students on a pretest. No significant benefit was shown for the adaptive condition. The paper presents and discusses these results and speculates on how the adaptive version could be modified to better leverage desirable difficulties theory and lead to deeper student learning.</p>";

First, instead of focusing on short-team performance, we investigated the student performance after a delay of at least 7 days. Previous studies showed that, relative to predicting immediate performance, different features were useful in predicting delayed performance. Therefore, our second goal is to discover new features other than these were used on individualization and population averaging. We explored several class-level features that can be captured in intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), and we showed that some of them have encouraging predictive power.

In particular, nonverbal behaviors such as posture and gesture provide key channels signaling affective and motivational states. Developing a clear understanding of these mechanisms will inform the development of personalized learning environments that promote successful affective and motivational outcomes. This paper investigates posture and gesture in computer-mediated tutorial dialogue using automated techniques to track posture and hand-to-face gestures. Annotated dialogue transcripts were analyzed to identify the relationships between student posture, student gesture, and tutor and student dialogue. The results indicate that posture and hand-to-face gestures are significantly associated with particular tutorial dialogue moves. Additionally, two-hands-to-face gestures occurred significantly more frequently among students with low self-efficacy. The results shed light on the cognitive-affective mechanisms that underlie these nonverbal behaviors. Collectively, the findings provide novel insight into the interdependencies among tutorial dialogue, posture, and gesture, revealing a new avenue for automated tracking of embodied affect during learning.</p>";

        p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>VanLehn's recent meta-analysis suggests that the AI aspects of computer tutors are adding significant value beyond simple adaptive approaches. For example, the beneficial effects of human tutors and various computer-based interventions compared to regular classroom instruction have estimated values that range between 0.8 std and .31 std. At the upper end of effects are human tutors followed closely by computer tutors (0.74). At the lower end is simple computer-based practice with feedback systems (0.31 std). In this research we are concerned with estimating the effects of web-based homework (WBH) involving practice and feedback. An argument is made that this could serve as a more appropriate condition for comparing the benefits of additional AIED tutoring features. WBH gives students feedback on correctness only as they go. It does not offer hints, feedback messages on common wrong answers, or mastery learning in the problem selection algorithm (used in what VanLehn calls the outer loop). A second under appreciated aspect of WBH is that teachers can use the data to more efficiently review homework. Universities across the world are employing these WBH systems but there are no known comparisons of this in K12. In this work we randomly assigned 63 thirteen and fourteen year olds to either a traditional homework condition (TH) involving practice without feedback or a WBH condition that added correctness feedback and ability to try again. All students used ASSISTments to do their homework but we ablated all of the intelligent tutoring aspects of hints, feedback messages and mastery learning as appropriate to the two practice conditions. We found that students learned reliably more in the web-based homework condition and with a large effect size of 0.56. Given the small sample size and confidence interval for the effect, more studies are needed to better estimate the effect size of WBH. An argument is made that effects associated with the practice with feedback condition should serve as a more accurate baseline for comparing the benefits of additional AIED tutoring features. Future work will systematically compare conditions that add back in hints, feedback messages and mastery learning so that we can measure the value added by these components.</p>";

Both use student correctness as a binary input, but student performance on a question might better be represented with a continuous value representing a type of partial credit. Intuitively, a student who has to make more attempts, and has to ask for more hints, deserves a score closer to zero, while students who asks for no hints and just needs to make a second attempt on a question should get a score close to one. In this work, we present a simple change to knowledge tracing and a simple (non-optimized) method for giving partial credit. We report on fit to real data comparing the original knowledge tracing (OKC) model with this new KT that uses partial credit (KTPC), which outperforms traditional knowledge tracing reliably. The practical implication of this work is that this new techniques can be widely used easily, as it's a small change from the traditional way of fitting KT models.

These pathways show capabilities for predicting student performance in these classes better than traditional assessments such as exams. This suggests that such data could be used to quickly develop effective instructional strategies targeted at potentially low-performing students. With this in mind, we present a methodology to characterize the different programming styles, and their relationship with a student's help-seeking behavior and performance in an introductory programming class. Preliminary findings show that programming style, as expressed in semantic features of a student's code, is predictive not only of student performance but also of whether or not a student got help. Based on these findings, we plan on developing a model of the impact of teacher intervention on a student's pathway through homework assignments.</p>";

Tutoring systems could be a transformative technology in these areas, where shortages of teachers and materials are persistent problems. However, the unique challenges and opportunities for ITS in this context are not well-explored. This paper identifies barriers to adoption distinct to the developing world, then presents the results of a systematic mapping study of recent ITS literature (2009-2012) that looks at the level of focus given to each barrier. This study finds that only a small percentage of peer-reviewed publications and architectures address even one of the barriers preventing adoption in these contexts.

In these environments, the learner can acquire knowledge in authentic situations through contextualized interaction with a mobile device. The challenge is to reconcile the freedom of movement and action, that characterizes authentic situations, with pedagogical control by the teacher, necessarily limiting this freedom. Our proposal aims to provide learners with situated interactions, while giving teachers the opportunity to integrate learning objectives that will influence the proposed interactions. Our application context is a school visit to museum. We propose to use semantic proximities over a semantic model of the domain (cultural heritage) and context (e.g. position in the museum, activity) to offer contextualized interactions. The use of semantic rules enables a loosely-based control of these activities by the teacher.</p>";

With the utilization of Virtual Learning Environments the number of modules being added to the environment generally relates to the number of modules being separately developed in an isolated environment. Although a certain level of overlap can be manually identified through clear connections such as similar subject themes and educator communication, a large quantity of similar content is often produced but never identified. This similar content can be seen at a Learning Object level where content has a high chance of being similar but also at a Module and Program level where data may not be inherently related. <br/>By identifying these similarities, the quantity of similar material developed can be reduced along with allowing other opportunities such as research collaboration in areas where module themes are closely linked but never identified as similar.<br/>This paper outlines the identification of similarities at a Learning Object, Module and Program Level. Once generated, these results are then visualized in graph form providing an insight into the overlap between course material. This process allows for previously unseen connections between course material to be identified on a larger scale utilizing existing data structures along with traditional similarity metrics to provide a deeper understanding of the similarities between course content. <br/>During this study, the level of similarities identified proved to be significantly higher than originally anticipated allowing for a review of the content to be made.<br/>Cristobal Romero, Juan Luis Olmo and Sebasti??n Ventura.

        p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) is a common way of determining student knowledge in adaptive educational systems and cognitive tutors. The basic BKT is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that models student knowledge based on five parameters: prior, learn rate, forget, guess, and slip. Expectation Maximization (EM) is often used to learn these parameters from training data. However, EM is a time consuming process, and it is prone to converging to erroneous, implausible local optima depending on the initial values of the BKT parameters. In this paper we address these two problems by using Spectral Learning (SL) to learn a Predictive State Representation (PSR) that represents of the BKT HMM directly from the data. Then we use a heuristic to extract the BKT parameters from the learned PSR using basic matrix operations. In the past few years, spectral techniques have been used to develop fast and local-optimum-free solutions to real-world problems involving latent variables in dynamical systems, computer vision, and natural language processing. The spectral learning method is based on an approximate factorization of the estimated covariance of windows from students' sequences of correct and incorrect responses; it is fast, local-optimum-free, and statistically consistent. We hypothesize that the parameters learned by SL can replace the parameters extracted by EM; the results of our study show that SL can improve knowledge tracing parameter fitting time significantly while maintaining the same prediction accuracy.</p>";

        p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>In recent years, student modeling has been extended from predicting future student performance on the skills being learned in a tutor to predicting a student?s preparation for future learning (PFL). These methods have predicted PFL from a combination of features of students' behaviors related to meta-cognition. However, these models have achieved only moderately better performance at predicting PFL than traditional methods for latent knowledge estimation, such as Bayesian Knowledge Tracing. We propose an alternate paradigm for predicting PFL, using quantitative aspects of the moment-by-moment learning graph. This graph represents individual students' learning over time and is developed using a knowledge-estimation model which infers the degree of learning that occurs at specific moments rather than the student's knowledge state at those moments. As such, we analyze learning trajectories in a fine-grained fashion. This new paradigm achieves substantially better student-level cross-validated prediction of student?s PFL than previous approaches. Particularly, we find that learning which is spread out over time, with multiple instances of significant improvement occurring with substantial gaps between them, is associated with more robust learning than either very steady learning or learning characterized by a single ?eureka' moment or a single period of rapid improvement.</p>";

This discourages random guessing because although each true/false statement has only two possible answers, a problem containing N such statements has 2^N possible answers. Individual students may therefore be forced to submit many responses to the same true/false statement. I have studied student submission patterns to problems of this type with the goal of determining which of the individual true/false statements exhibit a large proportion of response switches (i.e. from true to false or from false to true) and which statements exhibit largely consistent responses. In this paper, I describe algorithms that allow an instructor to uncover those statements that exhibit class-wide randomness and also those that exhibit class-wide fixation on an incorrect response. The utility of the approach is suggested by the fact that examining statements which emerge as outliers according to these metrics uncovers several statements that probe known student misconceptions and also several that suffered from an error in problem construction.</p>";

However, little is known about how these learning processes interact: does representational understanding facilitate the acquisition of fluency (understanding-first hypothesis), or does fluency enhance a student?s ability to acquire representational understanding (fluency-first hypothesis)? We analyze log data obtained from an experimental study. The goal of the experiment was to investigate the interaction between instructional support for representational understanding and fluency in making connections between multiple graphical representations of fractions (e.g., circle diagrams, rectangles, and number lines). The results from the experiment showed that instructional support for representational understanding and for representational fluency are needed in order for students to benefit from the intervention. In analyzing the tutor log data, we contrast the understanding-first hypothesis and the fluency-first hypothesis, testing whether errors students made while working with an intelligent tutoring system mediate the effect of experimental condition. Finding that a simple statistical model did not fit data from the experiment, we searched over all possible mediation models consistent with background knowledge, finding several that fit the data well. Our evidence is consistent with the understanding-first hypothesis but not with the fluency-first hypothesis. Our findings make predictions that can be empirically tested in future work: our results support the hypothesis that providing instructional support for representational understanding before instructional support for fluency will lead to better learning than providing support for representational fluency before support for representational understanding.</p>";

However, increasing numbers of students are using educational software at this phase of their education, and detectors of specific aspects of student learning and engagement have been developed for these types of learning environments. If these types of models can be used to predict college attendance, it may provide more actionable information than the previous generation of predictive models.

For this study, we developed over 300 n-gram indices and assessed their potential to predict human ratings of essay quality. A combination of these n-gram indices explained over 30% of the variance in human ratings for essays in a training and testing corpus. A second analysis that only examined essays that had three or more paragraphs explained over 20% of the variance in human ratings in a training and test set. The findings from this study indicate the strength of using n-gram indices to automatically assess writing quality. Such indices not only explain text-based factors that influence human judgments of essay quality, but also provide new methods for automatically assessing writing quality. Such methods have important implications for providing formative feedback in automatic writing evaluation (AWE) and linking this feedback to instructional modules in intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) that teach writing strategies.</p>";

Online learning environments, such as intelligent tutoring systems, have proven to be one effective means for accomplishing this. Here, we investigate a method for capturing students' ordinary handwritten coursework in digital form. We provided students with Livescribe digital pens which they used to complete all of their homework and exams. These pens work as traditional pens but additionally record students' handwriting as time-stamped pen strokes enabling us to analyze not only the ???nal image, but also the sequence in which it was written. By applying data mining techniques to digital copies of students' handwritten work, we seek to gain insights into the cognitive processes<br/>employed by students in an ordinary work environment.<br/>We present a novel transformation of the pen stroke data, which represents each student?s homework solution as a sequence of discrete actions. We apply differential data mining techniques to these sequences to identify those patterns of actions that are more frequently exhibited by good-performing students, and those exhibited by poor-performing ones. We compute numerical features from those patterns which we use to predict performance in the course. The resulting model explains 34.4% of the<br/>variance in students' final course grade. Furthermore the underlying parameters of the model indicate which patterns best correlate with performance. These patterns in turn provide valuable insight into the cognitive processes employed by students, which can be directly used by the instructor to identify and address de???ciencies in students' understanding.</p>";

We propose a novel approach that aims to address this by discovering the strategies followed by students working in small-groups at a multi-tabletop classroom. We apply two data mining techniques, sequence and process mining, to analyse the actions that distinguish groups that needed more coaching from the ones that were working more effectively. To validate our approach we analysed data that was automatically collected from a series of authentic university tutorial classes. The contributions of this paper are: i) an approach to mine face-to-face collaboration data unobtrusively captured at a classroom with the use of multi-touch tabletops, and ii) the implementation of sequence mining and process modelling techniques to analyse the strategies followed by groups of students.

We moved towards this goal by using data collected from students who engaged in self-directed learning which allows them to have full control over their learning but requires them to manage their own learning goals. Due to the minimal control over the students' behavior in the domain, context-based features were identified and created to represent learning in such an environment then used for building the affect models.

A traditional approach is to use event logs of students' interaction with computer models as an input to process mining algorithms. However, processes of students' interaction tend to be flexible, little structured and composed from large numbers of such fine grained technical events. Consequentially the identified patterns from the event-sequences can be hard to interpret and may not necessary represent students' intentions. In this paper, we present a technique that we have developed to transform sequences of technical events into sequences of more abstract actions and activities. The sequences of actions and activities are then used for discovering patterns of students' interaction with computer models. Our approach automatically segments sequences of events and clusters them into actions and then classifies actions into higher semantic level activities. We demonstrate the usefulness of our multilevel abstraction for extracting and exploring the main characteristics of how learners interact with computer models. Our study shows that each abstraction level helps to identify distinct characteristics of students' interaction.</p>";

SPARse Factor Analysis (SPARFA) is a novel framework for machine learning-based learning analytics, which estimates a learner's knowledge of the concepts underlying a domain, and content analytics, which estimates the relationships among a collection of questions and those concepts. SPARFA jointly learns the associations among the questions and the concepts, learner concept knowledge profiles, and the underlying question difficulties, solely based on the correct/incorrect graded responses of a population of learners to a collection of questions. In this paper, we extend the SPARFA framework significantly to enable: (i) the analysis of graded responses on an ordinal scale (partial credit) rather than a binary scale (correct/incorrect); (ii) the exploitation of tags/labels for questions that partially describe the question{concept associations. The resulting Ordinal SPARFA-Tag framework greatly enhances the interpretability of the estimated concepts.

The recently developed SPARse Factor Analysis (SPARFA) framework provides a new statistical model and algorithms for machine learning-based learning analytics, which estimate a learner's knowledge of the latent concepts underlying a domain, and content analytics, which estimate the relationships among a collection of questions and the latent concepts. SPARFA estimates these quantities given only the graded responses to a collection of questions. In order to better interpret the estimated latent concepts, SPARFA relies on a post-processing step that utilizes user-defined tags (e.g., topics or keywords) available for each question. In this paper, we relax the need for user-defined tags by extending SPARFA to jointly process both graded learner responses and the text of each question and its associated answer(s) or other feedback. Our purely data-driven approach (i) enhances the interpretability of the estimated latent concepts without the need of explicitly generating a set of tags or performing a post-processing step, (ii) improves the prediction performance of SPARFA, and (iii) scales to large test/assessments where human annotation would prove burdensome.

For this purpose, student solutions need to be represented in an appropriate form, so that an automated method can evaluate the (dis-)similarity of two solutions.

A discrepancy (or decoupling) between attention resources and text complexity was computed via an absolute difference score between participant reading times and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of the text. As expected, decoupling did vary as a function of text complexity. We also found that text complexity differentially impacted different types of participants (i.e., high vs. low comprehenders, fast vs. slow readers).

A student model is a model that can solve problems in various ways as human students. A good student model that matches with student behavior patterns often provides useful information on learning task difficulty and transfer of learning between related problems, and thus often yields better instruction on intelligent tutoring systems. However, traditional ways of constructing such models are often time consuming, and may still miss distinctions in content and learning that have important instructional implications. Automated methods can be used to find better student models, but usually require some engineering effort, and can be hard to interpret. In this paper, we propose an automated approach that finds student models using a clustering algorithm based on automatically-generated problem content features. We demonstrate the proposed approach using an algebra dataset. Experimental results show that the discovered model is as good as one of the best existing models, which is a model found by a previous automated approach, but without the knowledge engineering effort.</p>";

Further, in many classroom settings, students often complete activities in pairs rather than as individuals, with no coding to indicate the individual performing an action. We investigate whether pair interactions with an open-ended chemistry tutor can be used to predict individual student post test performance. Using L1-regularized regression, we show that student interactions with the tutor are predictive both of the average post-test score for the pair and of individual post-test scores. Towards a better understanding of pair dynamics in this setting, we also find that for pairs composed of students with similar pre-test scores, we can predict the difference in students' post-test scores. Our analyses demonstrate the potential of machine learning techniques to estimate student understanding in less structured tutors and for paired interactions.</p>";

However, one is often left wondering whether a statistically reliable or significant difference (for example, in the second or third decimal point of RMSE) between two models is really of practical significance. We address that problem by a proposing metrics that estimate how bad the poorer model is, in terms of misidentifying the point of mastery, if the better model correctly represents learner performance. A poorer model can be worse both because it requires practice opportunities for a particular student on a particular knowledge objective that are not needed (over-practice) or it does not require practice that is needed (under-practice). Our metrics estimate the absolute deviation of the bad model both in terms of opportunities and time. For example, we show that improvements in cognitive models from a Learning Factors Analysis search produces 15-20% absolute difference in ideal practice and that adding individual student estimates to Bayesian knowledge tracing produce about a 6-11% difference.</p>";

        p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>In their implementation of mastery learning, intelligent tutoring systems aim to present students with exactly the amount of instruction they need to master a concept. In practice, determination of mastery is imperfect. Student knowledge must be inferred from performance, and performance does not always follow knowledge. A standard method is to set a threshold for mastery, representing a level of certainty that the student has attained mastery. Tutors thus make two types of errors when assessing student knowledge: (1) false-positives, in which a student without knowledge is judged to have mastered a skill, and (2) false-negatives, in which a student is presented with additional practice opportunities after acquiring knowledge. Viewed from this perspective, the mastery threshold can be viewed as a parameter that controls the relative frequency of false negatives and false positives. In this paper, we provide a framework for understanding the role of the mastery threshold in Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and use simulations to model the effects of setting different thresholds under different best and worst-case skill modeling assumptions.</p>";

To answer these questions, designers need methods to expose the details of student play. We describe our approach for automatic extraction of conceptual features from logs of student play sessions within an open educational game utilizing a two-dimensional context-free grammar. We demonstrate how these features can be used to cluster student solutions in the educational game RumbleBlocks. Using these clusters, we explore the range of solutions and measure how many students use the designers? envisioned solution.

        p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Mastery learning in intelligent tutoring systems produces a differential attrition of students over time, based on their levels of knowledge and ability. This results in a systematic bias when student data are aggregated to produce learning curves. This is widely recognized as having a strong effect on the tail of the learning curve, which represents only those students who require a large number of opportunities to master the skill. Less well recognized is the influence that differential attrition has on earlier portions of the learning curve, and so this bias is often ignored in practice. In this paper, we provide a formal framework, based on Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, to evaluate the impact of differential student attrition in mastery learning systems. We show that, even in the ideal case, this bias leads to: (1) significant under-estimates of learning, and (2) learning curves that are unrepresentative of individual learners. The effect is compounded when there are sub-populations with significantly different learning characteristics within a sample. Under the influence of mastery learning, aggregate learning curves display complex dynamics subject to differential rates of learning and mastery assessment. We discuss several ways to address this problem, including alternative graphical representations of data, reconstructions based on models robust to this effect, and segmentation of student sub-populations.</p>";

One critical area that yet remains open, is examining teachers' usage of technology by specifically collecting detailed data of their technology use, developing techniques to analyze that data and then finding meaningful connections that may show the value of that technology. In this paper, we will present a model for predicting test score gains using data points drawn from typical educational data sources such as teacher experience, student demographics and classroom dynamics, as well as from the online usage behaviors of teachers. We build upon prior work in developing a usage typology of teachers using an online curriculum planning system, the Curriculum Customization Service (CCS), to assist in the development of their instruction and planning for an Earth systems curriculum in a large urban public school district. We apply the results of this typology to add new information to a model for predicting test score gains on a district-level Earth systems subject area exam. By using classification algorithms on the proposed model, we show that even with a simplification of the highly complex tapestry of variables that go into teacher and student performance, teacher usage of the online systems contains valuable information that hold some predictive promise. Studying several model variations of variables including classroom dynamics, such as demographics and class size, along with teacher skill and system usage, we show that both multinomial logistic and Naive Bayes algorithms have predictive capability in average and above average gains cases. We also show that such predictions are improved when consider online usage information. Such information may be an overlooked resource in in determining the effectiveness, benefits and costs of technology solutions given to teachers.</p>";

However, SL systems have trouble accommodating data from multiple distributions and troublesome data that contains irrelevant features or noise?all of which are relatively common in highly diverse LO data. The solution is to break up the available data into separate areas and then take steps to improve models on areas containing troublesome data. Unfortunately, finding these areas in the first place is a far from trivial task that balances finding a single distribution with having sufficient data to support meaningful analysis. Therefore, we propose a BoU meta-reasoning (MR) algorithm that first uses semi-supervised clustering to find compact clusters with multiple labels that each support meaningful analyses. After clustering, our BoU MR algorithm learns a separate model on each such cluster. Finally, our BoU MR algorithm uses feature selection (FS) and noise correction (NC) algorithms to improve models on clusters containing troublesome data. Our experiments, using three datasets containing over 5000 sessions of student interactions with LOs, show that multiple models from BoU MR achieve more accurate analyses than a single model.

        p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Learning involves a rich array of cognitive and affective states. Recognizing and understanding these cognitive and affective dimensions of learning is key to designing informed interventions. Prior research has highlighted the importance of facial expressions in learning-centered affective states, but tracking facial expression poses significant challenges. This paper presents an automated analysis of fine-grained facial movements that occur during computer-mediated tutoring. We use the Computer Expression Recognition Toolbox (CERT) to track fine-grained facial movements consisting of eyebrow raising (inner and outer), brow lowering, eyelid tightening, and mouth dimpling within a naturalistic video corpus of tutorial dialogue (N=65). Within the dataset, upper face movements were found to be predictive of engagement, frustration, and learning, while mouth dimpling was a positive predictor of learning and self-reported performance. These results highlight how both intensity and frequency of facial expressions predict tutoring outcomes. Additionally, this paper presents a novel validation of an automated tracking tool on a naturalistic tutoring dataset, comparing CERT results with manual annotations across a prior video corpus. With the advent of readily available fine-grained facial expression recognition, the developments introduced here represent a next step toward automatically understanding moment-by-moment affective states during learning.</p>";

        p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Open-ended educational tools can encourage creativity and active engagement, and may be used beyond the classroom. Being able to model and predict learner performance in such tools is a critical component to assist the student, and enable tool refinement. However, open-ended educational domains typically allow an extremely broad range of learner input. As such, building the same kind of cognitive models often used to track and predict student behavior in existing systems is challenging. In addition, the resulting large spaces of user input coupled with comparatively sparse observed data, limits the applicability of straightforward classification methods. We address these difficulties with a new algorithm that combines Markov models, state aggregation, and player heuristic search, dynamically selecting between these methods based on the amount of available data. Applied to a popular educational game, our hybrid model achieved greater predictive accuracy than any of the methods alone, and performed significantly better than a random baseline. We demonstrate how our model can learn player heuristics on data from one task that accurately predict performance on future tasks, and explain how our model retains parameters that are interpretable to non-expert users.</p>";

        p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>A student using an intelligent tutoring system may need to make multiple attempts to solve a problem, sometimes choosing to use hints and sometimes not. Past studies of hints in tutoring systems have found negative effects of hints, although hints are unlikely to hurt student performance. Examining log data from a tutoring system, we distinguish multiple attempts in which a student repeatedly seeks hints from multiple attempts to answer the problem. An exploratory data analysis shows that a tendency to request hints on a first attempt to solve a problem is correlated with requests on subsequent attempts, and proficiency at solving problems on a first attempt is likewise correlated with proficiency on subsequent attempts. Based on this, we distinguish hint-request tendency from proficiency in a multinomial logistic regression. The regression adjusts for selection effects due to individual hint-request tendency, individual proficiency, skill difficulty and prior practice with the skill. We find that seeking a hint is associated with repeated hint-seeking, but when students do make attempts to solve a problem after viewing a hint, they succeed about half of the time. Thus, the negative effects of hints are removed by our model. The model additionally shows that individual differences among students are more prominent in hint-seeking tendency, not in proficiency with hints.</p>";

Some researchers have been worked on student modeling to predict delayed performance, that is, retention. Prior work has found that the factors influencing retention are different than those influencing short-term performance. However, this prior effort was not using data which were specially targeted to measure retention. In this study, we described our experiments of using dedicated retention performance data to test the students' ability to retain, and experiment with a new feature called speed of mastery, which indicates how many problems the students need on initial mastery. We found that this new feature is the most useful of our features. It?s not only a helpful predictor for 7-day retention tests, but also a long-term factor that influences students' later retention tests even after 105 days. Also we found that, although statistically reliable, most features are not helpful, such as the numbers of students' previous correct and incorrect responses are not as helpful in predicting students' retention performance as in PFA.</p>";

Corbett and Anderson assumed the amount of learning that students do does not depend on whether students get items right or wrong. Corbett and Anderson thought it was a reasonable simplification to use in knowledge tracing where they assume that the amount of learning is equal whether students get an item right or wrong. Ohlsson and others argued that the student should learn more from a previous incorrect performance, especially in cases where the reasons for such poor previous performance are given. We decided to investigate a Bayes Network similar to KT but that allows us to have learning rates that are different according to whether students get items correct or not. In this case KT is just a simplification of our algorithm where we assume the amount of learning is equal in both cases. We report on a simulation study that shows that our model can learn back the parameters used to generate the data, suggesting that this model could be effective. We also report on fitting a large amount of real data drawn from the ASSISTments system. However, with real data, we did not get reliable improvements in model prediction. While the idea of allowing learning rates from previous incorrect performances to be higher seems intuitive, our experiments showed that this way does not lead to better predictions. Of course reasoning from a null result is dangerous, our contribution is that this intuitive idea is not one that other researchers should waste time in working on, unless they come up with a different model from the model we used (which is the naive way of modifying KT).</p>";

Algorithms for mining sequential patterns generally associate some measure of pattern frequency in the data with the relative importance or ranking of the pattern. However, when analyzing students' learning behaviors, another important aspect of these patterns is the evolution of their usage over the course of a student's learning or problem-solving activities. In order to identify and analyze learning behavior patterns of more interest in terms of both their overall frequency and their evolution over time, we present a data mining technique that combines sequence mining with a novel information-theoretic, temporal-interestingness measure and a corresponding heat map visualization. Further, we extend this technique to identify patterns that distinguish groups of sequences (e.g., groups of students in different experimental conditions) by differences in both total pattern usage and evolution of pattern usage over time. We demonstrate the utility of these two techniques through application to student activity data from a recent experiment with the Betty's Brain learning environment and a comparison of our algorithm's pattern rankings with those of an expert. The results support the effectiveness of our approach and suggest further refinements for temporal and differential analysis of sequential learning activity data.</p>";

Inferences based on a student?s online behavior can yield important implications for site construction. However, without student background information, inferences cannot also build on a deeper understanding of students' prior experiences, motivation, and home environment. In this short paper, we investigate the predictive power of student background factors as compared to student experiences with learning materials provided through the first MITx course, Circuits and Electronics? in the spring of 2012. We build on theories of social and cultural capital to compare the variance explained by access of different website resources (e.g., e-text, virtual laboratory assignments) to the variance explained by demographic and attitudinal factors (e.g., home country, language, parental education, gender) in predicting achievement. We focus on the group of course completers, who were also given a detailed background survey. We use multiple regression methods investigate the relationship between achievement over the course of the 14-week class, online resource use, and student background characteristics. We find that, while certain key resources?such as time spent on homework and time spent on the e-text?drive a greater amount of variation explained by site behavior, certain key demographics simultaneously explain a notable component of the variance. The demographics that matter are not individual factors like gender, but instead variables related to the home and learning environment experienced by the student outside the edX class. Pedagogical and sociological theory are combined here with data mining of thousands of online students to understand how formative offline experiences can change the effectiveness of online resources for students. Similarly, online course providers may be able to better tailor online experiences to students when they know how their home and school environment characteristics interact with their online experience.</p>";

Many promising ideas have resulted in negligible gains in accuracy, with differences in the thousandths place on RMSE or R2. This paper explores how well we can expect student modeling approaches to perform at this task. We attempt to place an upper limit on model accuracy by performing a series of cheating experiments. We investigate how well a student model can perform that has: perfect information about a student?s incoming knowledge, the ability to detect the exact moment when a student learns a skill (binary knowledge), and the ability to precisely estimate a student?s level of knowledge (continuous knowledge). We find that binary knowledge model has an AUC of 0.804 on our sample data, relative to a baseline PFA model with a 0.745. If we weaken our cheating model slightly, such that it no longer knows student incoming knowledge but simply assumes students are incorrect on their first attempt, AUC drops to 0.747. Consequently, we argue that many student modeling techniques are relatively close to ceiling performance, and there are probably not large gains in accuracy to be had. Furthermore, there are more useful student modeling tasks such as robust learning, wheel-spinning, and optimal spacing that are deserving of attention.</p>";

Our approach is to use causal modeling in Tetrad, a graphical modeling approach that makes causal inferences and explores multi level interrelationships within the data variables identifying direct and indirect effects among them. We are making critical analysis of the causal inferences generated by the causal model, whether the causal links are plausible and sufficient. While causal modeling is susceptible to over interpretation and requires considerable judgments from researchers, it can be a very helpful tool for analyzing data in educational settings, particularly where randomized trials are not always possible to conduct.

To extend this static model into a temporal model that accounts for skill-specific learning, we add knowledge tracing by using the static model to estimate the probability Pr(knew) of knowing a skill before practicing it. By generalizing to steps that require conjunctions of multiple subskills, we arrive at a combined model we call HOT-DINA (Higher Order Temporal, Deterministic Input Noisy-And gate).

Data from 117 middle school students using ASSISTments throughout the 2010-2011 school year were used to predict MCAS (Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System) score. A traditional model including only past performance on the test yielded an R2 of 0.38 and an enhanced traditional model that added current class average improved predictions (R2=0.50). These models served as baseline measures for comparing an ITS model. Logistic regression models that include features such as hint percentage, average number of attempts and percent correct overall improved the R2 to 0.57. Using the predicated score to classify students as advanced?, proficient?, or needs improvement? as determined by the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education improved accuracy by 7% over traditional models. The predictive power of the data is as effective with only a few months of use. Results indicate that classifying performance is more effective than predicting actual scores, but both are possible. Decision trees were also used to classify student performance but did not perform as well as the logistic regression, producing Kappa of 0.36. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the factors that have been determined to be most predictive, such as percent hint usage and percent correct including multiple attempts, are only attainable through the implementation of intelligent tutoring systems in the classroom and for nightly homework.

For the past 6-7 years, I have been <br /><br/>examining ways to leverage good video games to assess and support important student competencies, especially those that are not <br /><br/>optimally measured by traditional assessment formats. The term stealth assessment refers to the process of embedding assessments deeply<br /><br/>and invisibly into the gaming environment. Though this approach produces ample real-time data on a player's interactions within the game <br /><br/>environment and preserves player engagement, a primary challenge for using stealth assessment in games is taking this stream of data and <br /><br/>making valid inferences about players' competencies that can be examined at various points in time (to see growth), and also at various <br /><br/>grain sizes (for diagnostic purposes). In this talk, I will present recent work related to creating and embedding three stealth assessments--for <br /><br/>creativity, conscientiousness, and qualitative physics understanding--into Newton's Playground, a game we developed that emphasizes nonlinear gameplay and puzzle-solving in a 2D physics simulation environment. I will begin by framing the topic in terms of why this type of <br /><br/>research is sorely needed in education, then generally describe the stealth assessment approach, and finally provide some concrete <br /><br/>examples of how to do it and how well it works regarding validity issues, learning, and enjoyment from a recent research study.</p>";

I will illustrate this methodology by applying it to the learning of graphical isomorphs <br /><br/>of algebra problems. We discovered a sequence of 5 major phases that students went through: An Orient Phase where they identified the <br /><br/>problem to be solved, an Encode Phase where they encoded the needed information, a Compute Phase where they performed the necessary <br /><br/>arithmetic calculations, a Transform Phase where they performed any mathematical transformations, and a Respond Phase where they <br /><br/>generated the answer. The duration of the Compute and Transform Phases were they only ones that distinguished different problem types. <br /><br/>Increased duration in these two phases is also associated with making errors. Looking at learning, 2 features distinguished the problems <br /><br/>on which participants came to understand a new problem type. First, the duration of late phases of the problem solution increased. <br /><br/>Second, there was increased activation in the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) and angular gyrus (AG), regions associated with <br /><br/>metacognition.

        p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>We've started to answer the questions of what we can model through EDM, and we're getting better and better at modeling each year. We <br /><br/>publish papers that present solid numbers under reasonably stringent cross-validation, and we find that our models don't just agree with <br /><br/>training labels, but can predict future performance and engagement as well. We're making progress as a field in figuring out how to use <br /><br/>these models to drive and support intervention, although there's a whole lot more to learn.<br /><br/>But when and where can we trust our models? One of the greatest powers of EDM models is that we can use them outside the contexts<br /><br/>in which they were originally developed, but how can we trust that we're doing so wisely and safely? Theory from machine learning<br /><br/>and statistics can be used to study generalizability, and we know empirically that models developed with explicit attention to <br /><br/>generalizability and construct validity are more likely to generalize and to be valid. But our conceptions and characterizations of population <br /><br/>and context remain insufficient to fully answer the question of whether a model will be valid where will apply it. What's worse, the world is <br /><br/>constantly changing; the model that works today may not work tomorrow, if the context changes in important ways, and we don't know yet <br /><br/>which changes matter.<br /><br/>In this talk, I will illustrate these issues by discussing our work to develop models that generalize across urban, rural, and suburban<br /><br/>settings in the United States, and to study model generalizability internationally. I will discuss work from other groups that starts to think <br /><br/>more carefully about characterizing context and population in a concrete and precise fashion; where this work is successful, and where it <br /><br/>remains incomplete. By considering these issues more thoroughly, we can become increasingly confident in the applicability, validity, and <br /><br/>usefulness of our models for broad and general use, a necessity for using EDM in a complex and changing world.</p>";
