A deep revision of its assumptions is ongoing in the community due to the lessons learnt, and the contact with other ways to implement semantics in legacy as well as neighboring (academic or industrial) research programmes. I will discuss how semantics contributes to the shaping of web knowledge, and beyond that, of social reality. That will be related to cognitive aspects as well as technological results. In particular, I will present methods and tools for the extraction, representation, and harnessing of semantic patterns."

The BBC has also accumulated a very large archive of TV and radio programmes, as well as pictures, texts, musical scores etc. since 1922. Managing all this information constitutes a major challenge. In this talk we are going to give an overview of how Semantic Web technologies are being used on the BBC web site to facilitate consuming, managing and publishing this information. We will first describe various Semantic Web-related efforts undertaken by the BBC since 2004 and how those efforts are now converging in a BBC Linked Data Platform. We will then describe work undertaken by BBC R&D to investigate how a mixture of Semantic Web technologies, machine-generated annotations and crowdsourcing can enable us to publish large archives of content very quickly."

By now we have reached situation where we recognize that no matter how you organize or what methodology you choose, you just change one set of problems to another. In my presentation I will walk with you through biggest changes and do few deep dives on some of most challenging issues."

		k.description = "Social interactions have always been an important part of human learning and experience. We now know that social interactions are critical in many knowledge and information processes. Research has shown results ranging from influences on our behavior from social networks [Aral2012] to our understanding of social belonging on health [Walton2011], as well as how conflicts and coordination play out in Wikipedia [Kittur2007]. Interestingly, social scientists have studied social interactions for many years, but it wasn‚Äôt until very recently that researchers can study these mechanisms through the explosion of services and data available on web-based social systems. In this talk, I plan to illustrate a model-driven approach to researching social interactions on the Web. Our research methods and systems are informed by models such as information scent, sensemaking, information theory, probabilistic models, and evolutionary dynamic models. These models have been used to understand a wide variety of user behaviors, from individuals interacting with social bookmarks in Delicious to groups of people working on articles in Wikipedia. These models range in complexity from a simple set of assumptions to complex equations describing human and group behaviors. By using this model-driven approach, we further our understanding of how knowledge is fundamentally constructed in a social context, and a path forward for further social interaction research."

		p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Computing semantic word similarity and relatedness requires access to vast amounts of semantic space for effective analysis. As a consequence, it is time-consuming to extract useful information from a large amount of data on a single workstation. In this paper, we propose a system, called Distributed Semantic Analysis (DSA), that integrates a distributed-based approach with semantic analysis. DSA builds a list of concept vectors associated with each word by exploiting the knowledge provided by Wikipedia articles. Based on such lists, DSA calculates the degree of semantic relatedness between two words through the cosine measure. The proposed solution is built on top of the Hadoop MapReduce framework and the Mahout machine learning library. Experimental results show two major improvements over the state of the art, with particular reference to the Explicit Semantic Analysis method. First, our distributed approach significantly reduces the computation time to build the concept vectors, thus enabling the use of larger inputs that is the basis for more accurate results. Second, DSA obtains a very high correlation of computed relatedness with reference benchmarks derived by human judgements. Moreover, its accuracy is higher than solutions reported in the literature over multiple benchmarks.</p>";

		p.title = "Do We Need Entity-Centric  Knowledge Bases for Entity  Disambiguation? ";
		p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Entity Disambiguation has been studied extensively in the last 10 years with authors reporting increasingly well performing systems. However, most studies focused on general purpose knowledge bases like Wikipedia or DBPedia and left out the question how those results generalize to more specialized domains. This is especially important in the context of Linked Open Data which forms an enormous resource for disambiguation. However, the influence of domain heterogeneity, size and quality of the knowledge base remains largely unanswered. In this paper we present an extensive set of experiments on special purpose knowledge bases from the biomedical domain where we evaluate the disambiguation performance along four variables: (i) the representation of the knowledge base as being either entity-centric or document-centric, (ii) the size of the knowledge base in terms of entities covered, (iii) the semantic heterogeneity of a domain and (iv) the quality and completeness of a knowledge base. Our results show that for special purpose knowledge bases (i) document-centric disambiguation significantly outperforms entity-centric disambiguation, (ii) document-centric disambiguation does not depend on the size of the knowledge-base, while entity-centric approaches do, and (iii) disambiguation performance varies greatly across domains. These results suggest that domain-heterogeneity, size and knowledge base quality have to be carefully considered for the design of entity disambiguation systems and that for constructing knowledge bases user-annotated texts are preferable to carefully constructed knowledge bases.</p>";

		p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>DBpedia is a Semantic Web resource that aims at representing Wikipedia in RDF triples. Due to the large and growing number of resources linked to it, DBpedia has become central for the Semantic Web community. The English version currently covers around 1.7M Wikipedia pages. However, the English Wikipedia contains almost 4M pages. This means that there is a substantial problem of coverage (even bigger in other languages). The coverage slowly increases thanks to the manual effort made by various local communities. This effort is aimed at manually mapping Wikipedia templates into DBpedia ontology classes and then run the open-source software provided by the DBpedia community to extract the triples. In this paper, we present an approach to automatically map templates and we release the resulting resource in 25 languages. We describe the used algorithm, starting from the existing mappings on other languages and extending them using the cross-lingual information available in Wikipedia. We evaluate our system on the mappings of a set of languages already included in DBpedia (but not used during the training phase), demonstrating that our approach can replicate the human mappings with high precision and recall, and producing an additional set of mappings not included in the original DBpedia.</p>";

Research projects typically rely on either one or the other of these genres, and therefore there is a general lack of understanding of how these two genres compare and whether and how they could be used together to offset their respective weaknesses. This paper addresses these open questions. It first identifies the differences between the two genres, primarily in terms of cost, speed and result quality, based on existing studies in the literature. Secondly, it reports on a comparative study which involves performing the same task through both genres and comparing the results. The study‚Äôs findings demonstrate that the two genres are highly complementary, which not only makes them suitable for different types of projects, but also opens new opportunities for building cross-genre human computation solutions that exploit the strengths of both genres simultaneously.</p>";

Due to this proliferation in the use of ontologies, technologies and tools have been developed to facilitate the ontology engineering process and ontology population, as a part of this process. As spreadsheets are widely used to store and exchange data, academia and industry have developed a range of tools and mapping techniques to support the (semi-)automated translation of spreadsheet data into OWL/RDF. Existing tools vary in many aspects, therefore it can be difficult to select tool that fits best for a specific usage context. In this paper we analyzed several types of end users, which could be interested to apply such tools in their workflow, and their specific needs. Based on this analysis we propose an evaluation framework that could facilitate tools comparison; and c) search for an appropriate tool for a specific task/problem. In order to validate the proposed evaluation framework, a qualitative analysis of a set of six tools for ontology population has been performed.</p>";

An ontology-based graph matching technique continuously compares a person‚Äôs ‚Äòlive context‚Äô, with all previously-stored situations, both of which are represented as an instance of the DCON Context Ontology. Whereas each situation corresponds to an adaptive DCON instance, initially marked by a person and gradually characterised over time, the live context representation is constantly updated with mashed-up context information streaming in from various personal sensors. In this paper we present the matching technique employed to enable automatic situation recognition, and an experiment to evaluate its performance based on real users and their perceived context data.</p>";

We build on an interdisciplinary analogy between two connotations of the notion of ‚Äúscaffolding‚Äù: physical scaffolding from an architectural-engineering perspective and scaffolding of the ‚Äúeveryday knowing in practice‚Äù from a knowledge management perspective. Based on that, we classify visual structures for knowledge communication in teams into four types of scaffolds: grounded (corresponding i.e., to perspectives diagrams or dynamic facilitation diagrams), suspended (i.e., negotiation sketches), panel (i.e., roadmaps or timelines) and reinforcing (i.e., a visual domain glossary). The article concludes with a set of recommendations in the form of questions to ask whenever practitioners are making choices regarding which types of visual structures should be used for specific knowledge communication needs. Our recommendations aim at providing a framework at a broad-brush level to aid choosing a suitable visualization template depending on the type of knowledge management endeavor.</p>";

The visualization concept is based on previous work as well as insights from a user study with 20 participants.

		p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Researchers are more and more requested to publish their scientific data sets for purposes of transparency, re-use, and reproducibility. Particularly in economics and the social sciences, researchers often use sensitive statistical data that underlie protection policies which inhibit distribution to third party archives. In addition, a considerable quantity of data sets combines data from one or more external providers, which complicates the setting for curation-related activities. These circumstances give us reason to pursue a data restore model on the basis of fine-grained referencing that allows to trace data provenance to the original archive in charge of curation. One goal is to enable data publication in difficult cases, and another one is to show how the gaps between data citation and code integration can be closed in order to eliminate all manual efforts of arranging code and data files for reproduction attempts. On this basis we develop the requirements for a data restore model and elaborate a generic design in view of an overall data management infrastructure. We further explore an experimental implementation which we validate by taking the example of a real-world publication in economics. Eventually we close with the vision of a data and code ontology that carries statistical models from paper to a re-usable semantic level.</p>";

To answer this question, we conducted an exploratory empirical study at Barcamp Graz 2012. We applied a mixed-method approach: first we used a socio-demographic questionnaire (n=99) which allowed us to characterize the ‚Äôtypical barcamper‚Äô. Second, we conducted qualitative interviews (n=10) to get a deeper understanding of the participants‚Äô motivations to attend, expectations, and the use of social media in that context. We identified three concepts, which could be deducted from the interviews: people, format and topics. We found that the motivation to attend and even a common identity is quite strongly based on these three factors. Furthermore, the results indicate that participants share a set of activities and methods by following the barcamp‚Äôs inherent rules and make extensive use of social media.</p>";

However, there is, to our knowledge, no comprehensive framework for researchers and practitioners to compare the capabilities of the wide range of available OQTs.

		p.title = "The Foundations of Virtual  Ontology Networks ";
		p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>The notion of ontology network is relatively recent and rooted in the field of knowledge engineering. It concerns those ontology networks assembled at design time and established by their authors. Nowadays, however, the need to deal with heterogeneous semantic data sources, such as Linked Data and reengineered resources, gives rise to new use cases: ontologies now also need to be selected and combined in ways that were unpredictable at design time. This process is non-trivial and error-prone: if improperly dealt with, it can lead to loss of expressivity when interpreting resources (e.g. RDF graphs) as ontologies. Previous attempts at formally representing ontology relations assumed a controlled environment where axioms are unequivocally determined, and as such did not need to capture this distinction and its creeping issues. One possible solution is to assemble ontology networks at runtime by mimicking part of the design-time process; however, this requires that the difference between ontology networks assembled statically by their authors, and dynamically by consumer agents, be formally represented. The notion of virtual ontology network introduced here establishes this distinction. In this paper, we provide the theoretical underpinnings of virtual ontology network management. We define the representational primitives and abstract relationships that virtual networks are constructed upon. To validate the theory and demonstrate the feasibility of virtualization in contemporary ontology management, we show that this formal framework is compatible with the existing theory of ontology relations. To that end, we illustrate which constructs from existing representation languages can be used to implement the relations that characterize a virtual ontology network. We show this both in OWL 2 and with E-connections. This paper is a prelude to actual virtualization methods that we have devised and implemented: the finalization of their evaluation is underway and will be presented as a follow-up to the work presented herein.</p>";

		p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Browsing ontologies and making sense of their concepts and relationships are important activities in knowledge engineering. They are supported by a large number of tools that often provide visual representations of the ontologies for better illustration. However, different notations are used to represent the ontologies which can be confusing when switching tools. Furthermore, many representations provide only basic overviews of the ontologies that are not sufficient to get a deeper understanding of the concepts and relationships. A unified visual notation for OWL ontologies would be most helpful to overcome these limitations. Having this goal in mind, we compare two different notations for OWL ontologies in this paper: the UML profile of the Ontology Definition Metamodel (ODM) and the Visual Notation for OWL Ontologies (VOWL). We report on a comparative user study of these notations and discuss benefits and limitations raised by the study participants. Based on these findings, we draw some general conclusions regarding the development of a unified visual notation for OWL ontologies.</p>";

Yet, bringing these levels together for an integrated visual exploration across levels poses a challenge up to this day. With this paper, we aim to provide a first solution approach to this challenge, which decomposes the data in its various levels to be able to show them side-by-side. Based on this decomposition, we derive a visual exploration approach that consists of a novel multilevel visualization, adjoined traditional spatial and temporal views, as well as of tailored exploration techniques for their concerted use. We exemplify the utility of this approach by case studies on election and poll data from Germany‚Äôs various administrative levels and different time spans.</p>";

		p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>References+ is a business-related Web 2.0-based application designed to facilitate the worldwide sharing of knowledge, experiences, and best practices on the Siemens intranet. The underlying knowledge management approach has a strong focus on the user community, which currently comprises approximately 10,000 registered members located in more than 75 countries. To measure the individually perceived benefits generated by References+, a user survey was performed in 2011. This paper not only evaluates the survey results received from nearly 1,500 respondents, but also detects and discusses any correlations to factual use and contribution behavior measured by an evaluation of the respondents‚Äô system usage statistics. This allows a first attempt to explore the potential of a combination of perceived use and benefits (as measured by the user survey) with factual use (as measured by the corresponding usage statistics). As an important finding of this research, it was observed that higher perceived benefits correlate with usage frequency and the number of viewed contributions. The correlation is less strong regarding average contribution activity and for some cases ambiguous regarding the number of followers. Furthermore, it can be reported that in general a higher perceived use is also reflected in a higher factual use and in a higher number of followers.</p>";

		p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Linked Open Data (LOD) comprises of an unprecedented volume of structured datasets on the Web. However, these datasets are of varying quality ranging from extensively curated datasets to crowdsourced and even extracted data of relatively low quality. We present a methodology for assessing the quality of linked data resources, which comprises ofa manual and a semi-automatic process. The first phase includes the detection of common quality problems and their representation in a quality problem taxonomy. In the manual process, the second phase comprises of the evaluation of a large number of individual resources, according to the quality problem taxonomy via crowdsourcing. This process is accompanied by a tool wherein a user assesses an individual resource and evaluates each fact for correctness. The semi-automatic process involves the generation and verification of schema axioms. We report the results obtained by applying this methodology to DBpedia. We identified 17 data quality problem types and 58 users assessed a total of 521 resources. Overall, 11.93% of the evaluated DBpedia triples were identified to have some quality issues. Applying the semi-automatic component yielded a total of 222,982 triples that have a high probability to be incorrect. In particular, we found that problems such as object values being incorrectly extracted, irrelevant extraction of information and broken links were the most recurring quality problems. With this study, we not only aim to assess the quality of this sample of DBpedia resources but also adopt an agile methodology to improve the quality in future versions by regularly providing feedback to the DBpedia maintainers.</p>";

		p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>From a computational point of view, the semantic annotation of large-scale data collections is an extremely expensive task. One possible way of dealing with this drawback is to distribute the execution of the annotation algorithm in several computing environments. In this paper, we show how the problem of semantically annotating a large-scale collection of learning objects has been conducted. The terms related to each learning object have been processed. The output was an RDF graph computed from the DBpedia database. According to an initial study, the use of a sequential implementation of the annotation algorithm would require more than 1600 CPU-years to deal with the whole set of learning objects (about 15 millions). For this reason, a framework able to integrate a set of heterogeneous computing infrastructures has been used to execute a new parallel version of the algorithm. As a result, the problem was solved in 178 days.</p>";

		p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Recent studies come to the conclusion that Learning Management System (LMS) usage variables explain a higher variation in students‚Äô final grades than traditional student characteristics. Referring to such findings from literature our research aims at exploring dependencies between e-learning usage patterns and achieved learning results on the basis of LMS log-files from courses in different knowledge domains, and by analyzing courses not in isolation but by taking potential dependencies with students‚Äô activities in other courses into account. We examine correlations between usage variables and the students‚Äô performance in three blended learning courses with different topics based on large cohorts of students (n=883, n=389, n=578). In this context, an extended set of variables, including LMS usage beyond the three courses and usage patterns of students, are examined for interdependencies. Our results indicate that specific indicators, such as the number of active learning days and topic views, have a positive influence on learning results. In general, they show that at-risk students can be differentiated from well-performing students by their usage behavior. Moreover, we try to identify some significant patterns of LMS usage amongst the students. The paper shows how these patterns differ in our observations depending on the course domains.</p>";

One of the aims of this project is to develop an infrastructure for making the cancer related data publicly accessible, to enable cancer researchers anywhere around the world to make and validate important discoveries. However, data in the cancer genome atlas1 are organized as text archives in a set of directories. Devising bioinformatics applications to analyse such data is still challenging, as it requires downloading very large archives and parsing the relevant text files in order to collect the critical co-variates necessary for analysis. Furthermore, the various types of experimental results are not connected biologically, i.e. in order to truly exploit the data in the genome-wide context in which the TCGA project was devised, the data needs to be converted into a structured representation and made publicly available for remote querying and virtual integration. In this work, we address these issues by RDFizing data from TCGA and linking its elements to the Linked Open Data (LOD) Cloud. The outcome is the largest LOD data source (to the best of our knowledge) comprising of over 30 billion triples. This data source can be exploited through publicly available SPARQL endpoints, thus providing an easy-to-use, time-efficient, and scalable solution to accessing the Cancer Genome Atlas.

The paper builds upon the general organizational need to improve teams‚Äô processes to enhance and sustain team effectiveness. However, current research on facilitation is little synthesized across research disciplines and typically focuses on the end-product of collaboration rather than on the team process itself when assessing team effectiveness. This paper puts forward the idea that today‚Äôs recommender systems, or more specifically, their recommendations, already provide content facilitation and technical facilitation, respectively. Little is known about their theoretical grounding in behavioral sciences a well as the impact of recommendations on team processes. A research agenda is presented in the form of a discussion.</p>";

But due to legal issues, the special nature of human-bound knowledge and lack of acceptance by the staff only few case studies and even less evaluations in real world scenarios can be found. This paper presents a real world implementation of a simple expert recommender algorithm based on document authorship as well as an implementation of a directory of experts within one single company. Both have been implemented and therefore it is possible to compare the results of the recommender against data from the expert directory. Thus we wanted to gather first quantitative insights on how many documents a person should be author of before she might feel knowledgeable on a certain topic and even subscribe to it in the  directory of experts. These insights will also be presented.</p>";

		p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>The OpenMobileNetwork is a semantic model for mobile network topologies created by following the principles of Linked Data. By correlating data in the Linking Open Data Cloud with the OpenMobileNetwork, innovative Semantic Context-aware Services (CAS) can be realized that are not solely driven by classic context data (e.g., geographic location), but also include further information from the semantics of the context in use. So far, this open-source initiative provided rather static network topology data triplified from open-source cell databases, such as OpenCellID or OpenBMap. Integrating dynamic and live network context data (e.g., current traffic and number of users in a mobile network cell) by exploiting crowdsourcing methods will further improve the Semantic CAS experience since the historic and live state of a mobile network cell is a valuable data source to be taken into consideration when providing personalized services. The challenge in realizing such a crowdsourcing approach lies in motivating a significant number of users to contribute with their data. For this purpose, we have turned the OpenMobileNetwork from a static dataset into a Live Crowdsourcing Platform for Semantic CAS including a semantic cellular database based on extended network context ontologies, two smartphone clients, and a Measurement Framework for gamifying the crowdsourcing process of collecting network measurements. The measurement statistics highlight the effectiveness of this approach.</p>";

		p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>By building a Service Oriented system on top of a semantic repository, the expectation is to get the best of both worlds, i.e. strong modelling capabilities exposed by reusable services, which can be exploited as building blocks for third-parties applications. In reality some ‚Äúmismatches‚Äù make the combination not always optimal. Logic languages such as OWL and object-oriented languages such as Java have different paradigms. On the one hand, Software Oriented Architectures tend to favor stable interfaces for Web Clients, and to offer simplified versions of the objects used by the business logic on the server. On the other hand, Semantic Web clients make use of the rich semantics exposed by a semantic repository, which can be highly dynamic. This paper discusses these mismatches and suggests a different role for Software Oriented Architectures when integrated with Semantic Web technologies. The discussion is based on the experience in building a Web user interface using the services provided by a Service Oriented Architecture on top of a semantic repository.</p>";

		p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Gro√ür√§umige Verkehrsuntersuchungen ben√∂tigen Fahrtenmatrizen mit Angabe von Quelle, Ziel und gew√§hltem Verkehrsmittel f√ºr jede Fahrt. Fahrtenmatrizen werden zeit- und kostenintensiv mit Hilfe von Verkehrsnachfragemodellen berechnet. Als Eingangsdaten f√ºr Verkehrsnachfragemodelle dienen raumbezogene Strukturdaten, Verkehrsz√§hlungen und unterschiedliche Formen der Verkehrsbefragung. Daher stellt sich die Frage, alternative M√∂glichkeiten zur Gewinnung von Quelle-Ziel-Matrizen zu finden. Eine neue M√∂glichkeit der Datengewinnung bietet sich durch die wiederholte Erkennung mobiler Endger√§te (z.B. Mobilfunktelefone, mobiles Internet, usw.). Aufgrund der hohen Verbreitung von Mobilfunktelefonen und der M√∂glichkeit, diese orten zu k√∂nnen, wird seit einiger Zeit versucht, diese Technologie zur Verkehrsdatengewinnung zu nutzen. Die Position von beweglichen Mobiltelefonen (floating phones) wird √ºber die anonyme Ortung in einer Mobilfunkzelle durchgef√ºhrt. Die Nutzung der sogenannten pseudonymisierten IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) als individuelles Identifizierungsmerkmal jeder einzelnen SIM-Karte (Subscriber Identity Module) eines Mobilfunkger√§tes in GSM- und UMTS-Mobilfunknetzen (Global System for Mobile Communications, Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) erm√∂glicht es, Ortswechsel von SIM-Karten zu detektieren und z.B. die Reisezeiten einzelner Mobilfunknutzer zu berechnen und somit Informationen √ºber die Qualit√§t der Verkehrslage zu bekommen. Dieser Beitrag besch√§ftigt sich mit der Verwendung von Mobilfunkdaten als Eingangsdaten f√ºr Verkehrsmodelle. Raumbezogenes Verkehrsaufkommen und Verkehrsverteilung werden durch die Auswertung von Mobilfunkdaten √ºber einen l√§ngeren Zeitraum bestimmt. Neben einer Zeit- und Kostenersparnis soll durch die Einbeziehung und Kombination von Mobilfunkdaten mit derzeitig √ºblichen Erhebungsmethoden eine Qualit√§tsverbesserung erzielt werden. Eine offene Frage bei der Gewinnung von Nachfragematrizen aus Mobilfunkdaten ist die fehlende r√§umliche Kongruenz von Verkehrsbezirksgrenzen des Verkehrsmodells und der Zelleinteilung der Mobilfunkbetreiber. Weiterhin muss der Anteil der Mobilfunkbenutzer bezogen auf die Gesamtmenge der mobilen Bev√∂lkerung ber√ºcksichtigt werden. In diesem Vortrag werden L√∂sungen zu diesen beiden Fragestellungen anhand eines kalibrierten multimodalen Verkehrsmodells in Verbindung mit einem eigens entwickelten Softwarewerkzeug zur Auswertung von Quelle-Ziel-Beziehungen aus Mobilfunkdaten vorgestellt.</p>";

		p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Ontologies are commonly used for knowledge representation and to exchange information between multiple applications. When the same information is represented by different overlapping ontologies, information sharing requires a mapping between corresponding pairs of entities. While ontology alignment algorithms have been developed to support such tasks, they generally do not offer entirely complete and precise mappings. As a result, an important interactive aspect of the ontology alignment process is the validation of automatically generated mappings, as well as the addition of new mappings, by a knowledge manager. While visual ontology alignment interfaces exist to support these tasks, showing a large number of mappings can result in a significant amount of visual clutter. To address this issue, an edge bundling approach has been adapted to the constraints of an existing ontology alignment interface. A user study was designed and conducted to evaluate the value of edge bundling in this context, with positive results for both mapping validation and addition tasks.</p>";

As they share this knowledge integration challenge with many management contexts, we have examined the knowledge visualization practices of a leading regional police force (and of a military unit) in order to derive insights for corporate knowledge management. To do so, we have conducted on-site observations, focus groups, and interviews, as well as site-, document-, tool- and software- analyses within the police headquarters. As one main result of our empirical investigation, we find that the police force‚Äôs practice of hybrid (i.e., digital and physical) knowledge visualization offers a useful strategy for corporate knowledge management as well. We also show how organizations can apply this dual approach to making knowledge visible i.e., using sophisticated visualization software in combination with hands-on physical and permanently visible knowledge boards. We discuss how these two modalities can be combined to improve knowledge management and how this hybrid practice can be understood theoretically through the lens of boundary object theory. With this regard, we also extend boundary object theory by identifying nine dynamic qualities of collaborative visualizations.</p>";

		p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud has gained significant attention in the Semantic Web community recently. Currently it consists of approximately 295 interlinked datasets with over 50 billion triples including 500 million links, and continues to expand in size. This vast source of structured information has the potential to have a significant impact on knowledge-based applications. However, a key impediment to the use of LOD cloud is limited support for data integration tasks over concepts, instances, and properties. Efforts to address this limitation over properties have focused on matching data-type properties across datasets; however, matching of object-type properties has not received similar attention. We present an approach that can automatically match object-type properties across linked datasets, primarily exploiting and bootstrapping from entity co-reference links such as owl:sameAs. Our evaluation, using sample instance sets taken from Freebase, DBpedia, LinkedMDB, and DBLP datasets covering multiple domains shows that our approach matches properties with high precision and recall (on average, F measure gain of 57% - 78%).</p>";

		p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Governments and public administrations started recently to publish large amounts of structured data on the Web, mostly in the form of tabular data such as CSV files or Excel sheets. Various tools and projects have been launched aiming at facilitating the lifting of tabular data to reach semantically structured and linked data. However, none of these tools supported a truly incremental, pay-as-you-go data publication and mapping strategy, which enables effort sharing between data owners, community experts and consumers. In this article, we present an approach for enabling the user-driven semantic mapping of large amounts tabular data. We devise a simple mapping language for tabular data, which is easy to understand even for casual users, but expressive enough to cover the vast majority of potential tabular mappings use cases. We outline a formal approach for mapping tabular data to RDF. Default mappings are automatically created and can be revised by the community using a semantic wiki. The mappings are executed using a sophisticated streaming RDB2RDF conversion. We report about the deployment of our approach at the Pan-European data portal PublicData.eu, where we transformed and enriched almost 10,000 datasets accounting for 7.3 billion triples.</p>";

		p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Machine learning algorithms play in an important role in knowledge discovery due to their capability to analyze data for which only limited a priori knowledge is available. Unfortunately, their application and the extraction of information from the trained algorithm models highly depend on the nature of the analyzed data and the algorithm models. Therefore, the deployment of knowledge discovery processes in heterogeneous domains causes the requirement for time-consuming process adaptations. In this work, we argue that the value-centric feature vector representation used within machine learning is the main reason for the necessity to create such highly domain-specific setups. Therefore, the Semantic Pattern Transformation is presented, which transforms the value-centric feature vectors into a semantic representation ‚Äì the Semantic Patterns. The principle idea behind this process is to analyze the relations (co-occurrences) of feature values within the value-centric feature vectors, and use this information within a new vector-based representation ‚Äì the Semantic Patterns. The simple model used within this representation comes with many advantages, including the simplified setup procedure for arbitrary machine learning algorithms within heterogeneous domains and the simple interpretation of the underlying model. We have already successfully applied the Semantic Pattern Transformation in numerous applications including text analysis, event correlation, malware detection, analysis of Twitter data and Android application analysis. This work extends the application-oriented works by a detailed explanation of the method and a thorough evaluation of supervised and unsupervised learning scenarios, and the application within semantic-aware search algorithms.</p>";

		p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>While semantic technologies are successfully used in some more static and business critical domains like public management or financial services the adoption in innovation driven contexts has been more hesitant. The challenge of aligning knowledge development between innovation-driven context and knowledge organization systems by introducing social semantic technologies requires the shift from creation centered to addition centered approach in dealing with new concepts. For any organizational context there is something existent with applied classification logic which has to be considered while creating new knowledge. In order to study an impact of stabilizing and dynamic forces on knowledge organization systems we investigate concept compounding as ontological change. As new concepts emerge through knowledge maturing process and have direct impact on enterprise knowledge organization systems, a longitudinal approach is needed that follows development of new concepts over time. We took this approach by analyzing ontology maturing in an international company which provides professional services to both institutional and private customers. We present examples of the compounding of six new concepts as interactions between dynamic forces which are functioning within social technologies and stabilizing forces in the form of arbitrary knowledge organization systems. Based on our conclusions we propose Knowledge Alignment Model and list the services which will be developed further for applying Social Semantic Technologies in an organizational context. The model is a connection between the conceptual considerations presented as a shift from creation to addition and between design activities to make this shift happen.</p>";

		p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>This case study shows how the management of Intellectual Capital D.2.9 [Management Productivity] has been professionalized to the sustainable benefit of stakeholders. As a prototype application, the cluster initiative automotive-bw is of particular interest, because it represents a country wide association of nine regional clusters in Baden W√ºrttemberg, one of the world's leading automotive regions. automotive-bw is dedicated to achieve the ambitious goal of innovating energy efficient vehicles through the advanced networking of leading players across the country and thus contributes to global environmental protection as well as to securing the competitiveness of the local automotive industry (AUT10). Since 2010, Intellectual Capital is in the focus of analysis in the automotive-bw and now (2013) allows an evaluation of the developments over a period of 3 years. The results are incorporated into the controlling and risk management of the three cluster levels and are used to intervene proactively and to monitor the impact of management actions. As a result of PRIMA cluster (Professional Intellectual Capital MAnagement in clustered organizations), the transparency about the status quo of Intellectual Capital within the participating clusters could be increased. As a direct consequence, the cluster management could be improved. The participating cluster managers welcomed in particular the opportunity of gaining deep insights into the implicit patterns of the clusters involved. Additionally, the individual challenges of each cluster were discussed in a structured exchange of experience, based on qualitative benchmarking and thus served as a learning tool. The consolidation of the results of the regional clusters to a country level allowed the coordination of the inherently individual interests of each regional cluster and to set consensual priorities to strengthen synergies and to improve the competitiveness of automotive-bw. This alignment process and the resulting consensual allocation of efforts and funds to the prioritized fields of intervention warrants highest marginal benefits of the scarce public as well as private resources.</p>";

		p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Social interactions have always been an important part of human learning and experience. We now know that social interactions are critical in many knowledge and information processes. Research has shown results ranging from influences on our behavior from social networks [Aral2012] to our understanding of social belonging on health [Walton2011], as well as how conflicts and coordination play out in Wikipedia [Kittur2007]. Interestingly, social scientists have studied social interactions for many years, but it wasn‚Äôt until very recently that researchers can study these mechanisms through the explosion of services and data available on web-based social systems. In this talk, I plan to illustrate a model-driven approach to researching social interactions on the Web. Our research methods and systems are informed by models such as information scent, sensemaking, information theory, probabilistic models, and evolutionary dynamic models. These models have been used to understand a wide variety of user behaviors, from individuals interacting with social bookmarks in Delicious to groups of people working on articles in Wikipedia. These models range in complexity from a simple set of assumptions to complex equations describing human and group behaviors. By using this model-driven approach, we further our understanding of how knowledge is fundamentally constructed in a social context, and a path forward for further social interaction research.</p>";

In this talk we are going to give an overview of how Semantic Web technologies are being used on the BBC web site to facilitate consuming, managing and publishing this information. We will first describe various Semantic Web-related efforts undertaken by the BBC since 2004 and how those efforts are now converging in a BBC Linked Data Platform. We will then describe work undertaken by BBC R&D to investigate how a mixture of Semantic Web technologies, machine-generated annotations and crowdsourcing can enable us to publish large archives of content very quickly.</p>";

Originally developed in a digital libraries context (CULTURA project) for the evaluation of a research environment for cultural heritage collections, Equalia is grounded on a general conceptual approach that provides the opportunity to be applied also in other contexts. It allows specifying an evaluation model consisting of qualities (aspects to be measured) and instruments how to assess these qualities. Based on an established evaluation model data collection is supported by explicitly asking end-users during (individual questions) and after the usage (questionnaires) of the evaluated system, but also by monitoring the behaviour of users during the system usage (interaction data). The evaluation data, once collected, can be automatically analysed based on the defined evaluation models. Reports including diagrams are automatically created that take into account all these type of collected data. These different types of data are triangulated against the defined qualities, in order to get information about the overall quality of the evaluated system. Equalia exposes a REST interface for sending evaluation data to Equalia and also for receiving reports in machine-readable format. The latter allows the evaluated system to continuously get information about its qualities.</p>";

		p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>In the recent years a trend became very popular to create small applications for speci?c purposes with limited functionalities. This trend has also been taken up by learning environments technologies that allow for integrating such applications to a Personal Learning Environment (PLE). In the context of the EU-funded ROLE project (http://role-project.eu/), a platform has been created where users (learners and teachers) can create such PLEs. In contrast to other PLE technologies, ROLE offers a technical infrastructure that enables these applications (also called widgets) to communicate with each other and to store its data. Furthermore, such compilations (also called learning spaces) can be shared with others, e.g. a teacher can share the space with her students. The infrastructure also includes a learning ontology that allows for recommending applications for certain purposes. The ROLE Widget Store manages the applications and provides facilities to catalogue, tag, and search them. All this technology is based on a model of Self-Regulated Learning that guides learners through their learning process by effectively using the ROLE technology.</p>";

		p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>The KnowSelf application is intended to support reflective learning regarding personal time-management and self-organisation. The current version of the App logs user activities on the PC, namely applications and resources used together with the exact time of use. Thereby it provides an AS IS analysis of how users spend their time at work. The overview and various visualisations of the captured data are available in the App with the intention to lead to reflection on personal time management and potentially motivate improvements in this respect. The data are available only for personal use but can be shared anonymously for further analyses. This personal time management analysis tool is targeted towards knowledge workers who spend most of their working time on a PC. A majority of them face challenging situations at work, which are often accompanied by multitasking and time pressure. Therefore it is often very useful to reflect on the use of time and consider future changes. The ability to effectively organise their own time, which is a limited resource, is crucial in order to carry out the work effectively and to counteract frustration and stress at work.</p>";

		p.title = "Colour your Mood to Support the Emotional Knowledge Worker";
		p.paperAbstract = "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Sometimes nonverbal cues get lost in translation in virtual team meetings which only allow audio or partially video. In other situations, your team is co-located but everyone is very focussed on their work ‚Äì there is simply no time to pay attention to your feelings. We believe that emotions affect our work, how we work together and that we can learn from our moods as well as from the moods of our colleagues in order to improve our work performance. From theory we know that reflective learning is very relevant to achieve improvements in work performance and that emotions play a powerful role in that reflection process, as they are used to attend to feelings when recalling past situations. These feelings, positive as well as negative, could lead to a re-evaluation of past experiences and in the end to a change of behaviour. Motivated by these reasons we have created the MoodMap App, a web-based application which easily allows you to capture and track your own moods. You can express yourself by just clicking on a coloured bi-dimensional map. Features for adding context and private notes to your moods are implemented to reach a better contextualisation. Additionally, the app guides your mood tracking with different intelligent prompts, which make you aware of drastic individual mood changes or significant deviations between your mood to the team‚Äôs mood. Sophisticated visualisations on an individual as well as collaborative level are available to easily follow the mood development and to get feedback with automatically created mood reports within the app or via email. With these characteristics and features, the MoodMap App aims at supporting you to re-visit your own moods, re-evaluate the mood development of your colleagues captured during work related events, reflect and learn from them and finally improve your individual and team work.</p>";
